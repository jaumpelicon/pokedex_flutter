# pokedex

Created pokedex with Flutter.

## About my project:

I developed this pok√©dex project to learn more about the flutter framework and the dart language to evolve personally and professionally.

I used this API "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json " to request pokemons.

And based on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxyiXDST6_g&list=PLHAtJbrQ17AWaIWRiBl75ON3XEznUfX-a.

Some photos of the project:
